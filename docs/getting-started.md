## Installation

Add the following lines of code into your `build.gradle`.


```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.h6ah4i.android.widget.advrecyclerview:advrecyclerview:{{ library.version }}'
}
```

**NOTE:**
This library is served on [mavenCentral](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.h6ah4i.android.widget.advrecyclerview/advrecyclerview). If the above gradle setting doesn't work, try adding the following lines.

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

## What's next?

First, I recommend you to learn about plain [`RecyclerView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html). Basic knowledges about `RecyclerView` are required before using this library. The following tutorial is good for starting point;

- [Creating Lists and Cards | Android Developers - Training](https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html)


If you've already know well about plain `RecyclerView`, proceed to each sections written about what you want to use:

- [Wrapper Adapter](/wrapper-adapter/)
    - [`ComposedAdapter`](/wrapper-adapter/composed-adapter)
    - [Headers & Footers](/wrapper-adapter/headers-footers)
    - [Insertion & Filtering](/wrapper-adapter/insertion-filtering)
- [Drag & Drop](/draggable)
- [Swipeable](/swipeable)
- [Expandable](/expandable)
